# rafiki-bora-dashboard
A Web dashboard for a fictional microfinance organization.It is a role based system where the different roles such as Admin and Merchant 
have different views when you log in as either.When you log in as admin you are able to see all the functionalities.The application also
has CRUD functionalities where applicable.For the reports we integrated the system with a POS gateway which saved POS Terminal transactions
to the database.You can use the log in credentials on the login page to log in as Admin and have a feel of the 
system. <Link to website> https://rafiki-bora.web.app/
